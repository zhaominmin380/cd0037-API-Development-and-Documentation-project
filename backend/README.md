# Backend- Trivia API
## Step 1: Install Required Software
* **Python 3.7+**: Download from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* **Virtual Environment** (recommended): Set up using [Python venv documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
* **PostgreSQL**: Install from [https://www.postgresql.org/download/](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
## Step 2: Set Up and Populate the Database
With PostgreSQL running:

1.  Create the main database:
	```bash
	createdb trivia
	```
2. Optionally, create a test database:
	```bash
	createdb trivia_test
	```
3. Populate the main database:
	```bash
	psql trivia < trivia.psql
	```
## Step 3: Install Backend Dependencies
Navigate to the `/backend` directory and run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Step 4: Run the Backend Server
Make sure your virtual environment is active. Then from the `backend` directory:
### For Mac/Linux:
```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```
### For Windows (CMD):
```bash
set FLASK_APP=flaskr
set FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```
## Step 5: Run Backend Tests
```bash
python test_flaskr.py
```
This will run all unit tests for endpoint success and error cases using `unittest`.
