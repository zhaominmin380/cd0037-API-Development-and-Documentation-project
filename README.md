# API Development and Documentation Final Project

## Trivia App

This project is based on the Udacity Full Stack project.
The original goal of the project is to build a trivia game that allows users to manage questions and play quizzes. The frontend is built with React, and the backend is powered by Flask and SQLAlchemy.

## My Contribution

In this project, I was primarily responsible for implementing the backend logic in flaskr/__init__.py, including:

Creating all the RESTful API endpoints for questions, categories, search, and quiz play

Handling proper error responses and request validation

Integrating the database with SQLAlchemy models

I also completed and maintained the unit tests in test_flaskr.py, ensuring that all endpoints behave as expected under both normal and edge cases.

## Core Features of the API
Get paginated questions

Search questions using keywords

Filter questions by category

Add and delete questions

Play quiz game (randomized, with optional category filtering)
